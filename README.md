# Build My Own Minimal Lisp

## LISP
LISP, or LISt Processing, is a family of programming languages. Originally specified in the late 1950s, it is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use, after Fortran.

I am following a book [Build Your Own Lisp](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) to create my own minimal Lisp using the C programming language. Through this process, I am also learning C.
